# LPOO_35 - FarmVille

> FarmVille was a massive played game on Facebook around 2010. <br/>
> In this text-based implementation, you can manage a farm, including its crop fields and buildings.
> You can also go to the market where you can buy and sell seeds and other useful tools,
> a house where you can rest, and a warehouse where you can save your items. <br/>
> In this exciting new version you need to pay attention to the weather. Your fields need water to produce
> but if it rains too much, or a storm comes, you might lose some or even all of your hard work.
> 
> This project was developed by Diogo Costa (up201906731@fe.up.pt), Pedro Gonçalo Correia (up201905348@fe.up.pt) and Rui Alves (up201905853@fe.up.pt) for LPOO 2020⁄21.
