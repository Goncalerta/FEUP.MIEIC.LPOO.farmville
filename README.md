# LPOO - FarmVille

## Description

In this project we implement a text-based farm game based on FarmVille, a game developed by Zynga in 2009.
In this simplified version you control a farmer that may interact with buildings and crop fields around the farm.

The main objective is to earn money by selling the items produced in the farm, and use that money to expand the farm.

This project was developed by Diogo Costa (up201906731@edu.fe.up.pt), Pedro Gon√ßalo Correia (up201905348@edu.fe.up.pt) and Rui Alves (up201905853@edu.fe.up.pt) for LPOO 2020-21.
